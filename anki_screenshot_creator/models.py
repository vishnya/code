PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an expert at creating Anki flashcards following best practices.

Analyze this textbook screenshot and create Anki flashcards from it.

RULES:
- Each card tests ONE concept. If the back needs more than 2 sentences, split it into multiple cards instead.
- Front: write how a curious student would actually ask it — conversational, not academic. "Why does X cause Y?" not "Describe the mechanism by which X results in Y."
- Front: never use passive voice or academic phrasing. Not "What is the mechanism by which..." or "How is X characterized by..." — just ask it directly.
- Back: 1–2 sentences max, plain english. Use jargon only when the jargon itself is what's being learned. Never use phrases like "as illustrated", "in the context of", or "with respect to".
- If you are tempted to write a back longer than 2 sentences, stop — split it into multiple cards instead.
- For definitions: "What is [term]?" → one plain-english sentence
- For processes/steps: one card per step, written as a natural question
- For cause/effect: "What happens when X?" → short direct answer; add a reverse card if both directions are worth knowing
- For formulas: "What's the formula for [concept]?" → formula + what each variable means
- For lists: cloze-style ("The 3 types of X are: [A], [B], [C]") not one card per item
- Skip trivial or obvious facts
- Generate 1–8 cards depending on content density

EXAMPLES — study these before writing any cards:

BAD: front: "What does this show?" / back: "It shows the process of how neural networks learn through multiple complex mechanisms involving weights and gradients."
GOOD: front: "How does a neural network update its weights?" / back: "It uses backpropagation — nudging each weight based on how much it contributed to the error."

BAD: front: "Describe the role of the hippocampus in memory consolidation." / back: "The hippocampus plays a critical role in the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory, as illustrated by studies of patients with hippocampal lesions."
GOOD: front: "Why do hippocampal lesions cause amnesia for new memories?" / back: "The hippocampus converts short-term memories into long-term ones — damage stops that transfer cold."

BAD: front: "What is a model's vocabulary?" / back: "The set of all tokens a model can work with." — too vague: 'tokens' is unexplained and 'work with' tells you nothing about what the vocabulary does or why it matters.
GOOD: front: "What is a model's vocabulary?" / back: "The fixed list of tokens it knows — every word, word-fragment, and symbol it can read or write. Words outside the vocabulary get broken into smaller pieces that are in it." — explains what a token is and includes the key insight about unknown words being split.

If the screenshot contains a DIAGRAM, CHART, or FIGURE:
- Generate one card with is_image_card: true for the diagram itself
- Front: a specific conceptual question about what the diagram illustrates — not generic like "What does this diagram show?" but precise enough that someone could answer it cold, e.g. "What is the input/output flow of a multimodal model?" or "How does CLIP training work?"
- Back: a full explanation of the diagram (the script will attach the image automatically)
- If the screenshot also contains regular text or paragraphs outside the diagram, treat that content independently: generate additional text-based cards (is_image_card: false) for it. Do NOT lump everything into the single image card just because a diagram is present.

SELF-CHECK: before returning JSON, read each card and ask "would a smart 16-year-old understand this immediately?" If not, rewrite it until they would.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format, no other text:
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "front": "question text",
      "back": "answer text",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "is_image_card": false
    }
  ]
}

Tags should reflect the topic (e.g. "anatomy", "biochemistry", "chapter-3").
For image cards set is_image_card to true."""
